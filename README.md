## Introduction

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used in the cybersecurity domain. This roadmap provides a structured approach to learning Python with a focus on its applications in hacking and security testing.

## Objectives

By following this roadmap, learners will:

- Develop a solid understanding of Python programming basics.
- Gain skills in using Python for networking and web scraping.
- Learn how to automate tasks and perform penetration testing.
- Complete practical projects to reinforce their learning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this roadmap, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts.
- Familiarity with ethical hacking principles.
- A computer with Python installed (version 3.x).

## Getting Started

To begin, clone this repository and follow the modules in order. Ensure you have Python installed and set up your development environment as outlined in the first module.

## Roadmap Overview

The roadmap consists of several key modules that will guide you through learning Python in the context of hacking. Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of both Python and hacking techniques.

### Learning Path

1. **Introduction to Python**

   - Overview of Python and its applications.
   - Setting up Python environment.
   - Basic syntax and data types.
2. **Control Structures and Functions**

   - Conditional statements and loops.
   - Writing and using functions.
3. **Working with Data**

   - Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
   - File handling (reading/writing files).
4. **Networking with Python**

   - Understanding TCP/IP.
   - Using sockets to create client-server applications.
5. **Web Scraping and APIs**

   - Introduction to web scraping with BeautifulSoup.
   - Consuming RESTful APIs.
6. **Automating Tasks**

   - Using Python for task automation.
   - Scripting with Python (Bash, Windows CMD).
7. **Security and Hacking**

   - Introduction to ethical hacking.
   - Using Python for penetration testing.
   - Popular libraries (e.g., Scapy, Requests, Paramiko).
8. **Real-world Projects**

   - Building a simple port scanner.
   - Developing a web application vulnerability scanner.

## Practical Tips

- **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key! Dedicate time each week to practice coding.
- **Join a Community**: Engage with forums or groups related to Python and cybersecurity.
- **Work on Projects**: Apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios to solidify your skills.
